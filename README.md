# Computer-Vision-OpenCV
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data, such as images and videos. 
It involves tasks like image recognition, object detection and image segmentation.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. 
It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for tasks related to computer vision, image processing, and machine learning. 
OpenCV is written in C++ and has bindings for various programming languages, including Python. 
It is widely used in academic research, industry, and hobbyist projects for applications like object detection, image filtering, camera calibration, and video analysis.
